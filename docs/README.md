# Cloudflare Update IP Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Cloudflare Update IP**. This project contains a Windows batch script that updates all `A` records in your Cloudflare account to a new IP address. It is useful when moving servers or dealing with dynamic IP addresses.

This GitBook explains how to configure the script, run it safely, and schedule updates automatically.

We recommend reading through all sections before executing the script because it will modify every `A` record accessible with your Cloudflare credentials.
